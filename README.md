Lost & Found App
A simple Android app to help users post, view, and remove lost & found items using an SQLite database.

Overview
The Lost & Found App allows users to:
Post adverts for lost or found items.
View all posted items in a list.
Remove adverts when items are returned to their owners.
This app is designed to make it easy for people to reconnect lost items with their rightful owners.
